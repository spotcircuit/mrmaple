<span style="color: #ffffff;"><em></em></span><strong>'Angyo Weeping' is a recent selection of a trident from Japan that can reach 15-20 ft in height while cascading downward with long pendulous ornamental branches. 'Angyo Weeping' is extremely heat tolerant and vigorous. Fall colors are bright oranges to reds. 'Angyo Weeping' works great as either a focal point planting or a background planting. This maple is excellent for containers. The unique texture of 'Angyo Weeping' provides a lot of interest in the landscape, even in the winter. <br><br>As this tree ages, it attains a nice exfoliating grey bark, providing even more interest in the winter garden. This Japanese trident maple received its name as it was found in the Angyo prefecture in Japan. 'Angyo Weeping' is an excellent addition to any garden.</strong>

<meta charset="utf-8">Abies lasiocarpa 'Glacier Blue', also known as the Dwarf Alpine Fir, is a stunning conifer with vibrant blue-silver needles that retain their striking color all year. This slow-growing, compact evergreen reaches a height of 3 to 5 ft and a width of 2 to 3 ft over 10 years. With its dense branching and pyramidal form, it is well-suited for small gardens, rockeries, or container planting. Thriving in full sun to partial shade, it prefers well-drained, slightly acidic soil. 'Glacier Blue' is highly valued for its bold color and compact size, making it a standout in any landscape or conifer collection.</h4>
